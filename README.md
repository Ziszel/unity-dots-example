# Skyfall (a small project exploring the Unity DOTS stack)

## Project goals

I created this project so that I could experiment with the various technologies that make up Unity DOTS. By building a foundation of how data orientated design is implemented within Unity, I can then use this knowledge to improve the performance of my future projects. 

I want to achieve the following:
~- Utilise ECS within Unity; operate on entities instead of gameobjects~  
~- Use Burst to improve performance on sections of code that only use unmanaged types~  
~- Use jobs to further improve performance via parallel processing (multithreading)~  
~- Connect entities and gameobjects together via event delegates~  
~- Move entities via the new input system~  
- Use Unity.Physics to manage collisions and movement of the player
